<h2>Scan for an additional pair of QTL in a multiple-QTL model</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Scan for an additional pair of QTL in the context of a
multiple QTL model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
addpair(cross, chr, pheno.col=1, qtl, covar=NULL, formula,
        method=c("imp","hk"), incl.markers=FALSE, verbose=TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cross</code></td>
<td>
An object of class <code>cross</code>. See
<code><a href="read.cross.html">read.cross</a></code> for details.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>chr</code></td>
<td>
Optional vector indicating the chromosomes to be scanned.
If missing, all chromosomes are scanned.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pheno.col</code></td>
<td>
Column number in the phenotype matrix to be
used as the phenotype.  One may also give a character string matching
a phenotype name.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>qtl</code></td>
<td>
An object of class <code>qtl</code>, as output from
<code><a href="makeqtl.html">makeqtl</a></code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>covar</code></td>
<td>
A data.frame of covariates.  These must be strictly
numeric.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
An object of class <code><a href="../../stats/html/formula.html">formula</a></code>
indicating the model to be fitted.  QTLs are referred to as
<code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, etc.  Covariates are referred to by their names
in the data frame <code>covar</code>.  If the new QTL are not included in
the formula, a two-dimensional scan as in <code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>
is performed.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
Indicates whether to use multiple imputation or
Haley-Knott regression.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>incl.markers</code></td>
<td>
If FALSE, do calculations only at points on an
evenly spaced grid.  If <code><a href="calc.genoprob.html">calc.genoprob</a></code> or

<code>stepwidth="variable"</code>, we force <code>incl.markers=TRUE</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>

If TRUE, display information about the progress of
calculations.  If <code>verbose</code> is an integer &gt; 1, further messages

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The formula is used to specified the model to be fit. In the
formula, use <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, etc., or <code>q1</code>,
<code>q2</code>, etc., to represent the QTLs, and the column names in the
covariate data frame to represent the covariates.
</p>
<p>
We enforce a hierarchical structure on the model formula: if a QTL or
covariate is in involved in an interaction, its main effect must also
be included.   
</p>
<p>
If neither of the two new QTL are indicated in the <code>formula</code>, we
perform a two-dimensional scan as in <code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>.  That
is, for each pair of QTL positions, we fit two models: two
additive QTL added to the <code>formula</code>, and two interacting QTL
added to the <code>formula</code>.
</p>
<p>
If the both of the new QTL are indicated in the <code>formula</code>, that
particular model is fit, with the positions of the new QTL allowed to
vary across the genome.  If just one of the QTL is indicated in the
<code>formula</code>, a main effect for the other is added, and that
particular model is fit, again with the positions of both QTL varying.
Note that in this case the LOD scores are not analogous to those
produced by <code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>.  Thus, there slightly modified forms
for the plots (produced by <code><a href="plot.scantwo.html">plot.scantwo</a></code>) and
summaries (produced by <code><a href="summary.scantwo.html">summary.scantwo</a></code> and
<code><a href="max.scantwo.html">max.scantwo</a></code>).  In the plot, the x-axis is to be
interpreted as the position of the first of the new QTL, and the
y-axis is to be interpreted as the position of the second of the new
QTL.  In the summaries, we give the single best pair of positions on
each pair of chromosomes, and give LOD scores comparing that pair of
positions to the base model (without each of these QTL), and to the
base model plus one additional QTL on one or the other of the chromosomes.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
An object of class <code>scantwo</code>, as produced by
<code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>.
</p>
<p>
If neither of the new QTL were indicated
in the <code>formula</code>, the result is just as in
<code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>, though with LOD scores relative to the
base model (omitting the new QTL).
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the results are contained in what would ordinarily be in
the full and additive LOD scores, with the additive LOD scores
corresponding to the case that the first of the new QTL is to the left
of the second of the new QTL, and the full LOD scores corresponding to
the case that the first of the new QTL is to the right of the second
of the new QTL.  Because the structure of the LOD scores in this
case is different from those output by <code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>, we
include, in this case, an attribute <code>"addpair"=TRUE</code>.  (We also
require results of single-dimensional scans, omitting each of the two
new QTL from the formula, one at a time; these are included as
attributes <code>"lod.minus1"</code> and <code>"lod.minus2"</code>.)  The
results are then treated somewhat differently by
<code><a href="summary.scantwo.html">summary.scantwo</a></code>, <code><a href="max.scantwo.html">max.scantwo</a></code>,
and <code><a href="plot.scantwo.html">plot.scantwo</a></code>.  See the Details section.
