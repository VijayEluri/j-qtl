<h1>Edit Preferences</h1>
<p>The edit preferences dialog allows the user to select a new R installation 
for J/qtl to run against, or to change the amount of memory allocated to 
J/qtl</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The R Home Tab</h2>
<p>          
        The user can either directly type 
in the location of the new R Home directory, select from the list of detected 
installations&nbsp;or select the directory using the file browser button. After 
the user OK's their selection the directory is validated to make sure that a 
compatible version of R has been selected and the user is notified that no 
changes will take effect until J/qtl is restarted.</p>

<H2>The Memory Limits Tab</H2>
<P>The preferences panel allows the user to seperately limit the Java Memory 
Limit which has to do with the user interface and the R Memory Limit which has 
to do with most of the statistical computation. Note that the R Memory Limit 
will only be available on Windows platforms. Typically you can leave both of 
these as default values unless your application is running out of memory. If R 
is running out of memory it you will usually get an error message in the R 
terminal panel at the bottom of the J/qtl window. If Java running out of memory 
usually shows up as dialogs refusing to open, but this situation can be more 
difficult to detect.</P>
