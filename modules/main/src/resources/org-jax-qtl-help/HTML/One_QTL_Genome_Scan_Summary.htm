<h1>One QTL Genome Scan Summary</h1>
<p>The One QTL Genome Scan Summary or "Scan One Summary" 
dialog can be used to view and filter the output of a <A 
href="One_QTL_Genome_Scan.htm">One QTL Genome Scan</A>. In effect, this dialog 
is acting as a graphical interface for R/qtl's <A 
href="summary.scanone.html">summary.scanone</A> function. See the R/qtl 
documentation for more detailed information on how the scan results are 
filtered.</p>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../Images/scanone-summary-1.png" border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The initial set of three drop-down selection controls can be used to select 
the cross, scan results and phenotype to summarize. The "Threshold" dropdown can 
be used to filter the results by LOD score or by an alpha threshold (the alpha 
threshold is only available if permutations have been calculated).</P>
<P>The control buttons at the bottom of the dialog work as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Toggle Select All Displayed: will either select or 
  deselect all table rows that have not been filtered out 
  <LI>Add Selected Markers to QTL Basket: will add the 
  markers from all of the table rows that have checked boxes to a QTL Basket. 
  <LI>Export Table: allows the user to export the table to a comma-separated 
  file</LI></UL>
