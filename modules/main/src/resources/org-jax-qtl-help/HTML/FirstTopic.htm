<h1>Welcome to&nbsp;J/qtl</h1>
<P>J/qtl is a Java GUI for the popular QTL data analysis software <A 
href="http://www.rqtl.org">R/qtl</A>.&nbsp; It provides a flexible and powerful 
working environment for users to perform a variety of tasks.</P>
<H3>How it works</H3>
<P>J/qtl is a graphical user interface for R/qtl, which is an add-on package for 
the freely available statistical language R. While R/qtl is a powerful data 
analysis software package, it requires some programming skill. We developed 
J/qtl to help people without programming skill to analyze their data. The 
software works in such a way that people do their job through the point click 
interface. The software translates the users' actions into R commands, runs the 
commands in R, and&nbsp;gets the result back to display them. So R and R/qtl are 
the actual work horses. J/qtl uses&nbsp;the third party software library <A 
href="http://www.rforge.net/JRI">JRI</A> as the middleman between the GUI and 
R.</P>
