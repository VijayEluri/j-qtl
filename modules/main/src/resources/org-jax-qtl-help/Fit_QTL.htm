<h1>Fit QTL</h1>
<p>The Fit QTL dialog acts as a graphical interface to R/qtl's <A 
href="HTML/makeqtl.html">makeqtl</A> and <A href="HTML/fitqtl.html">fitqtl</A> 
functions. See the R/qtl documentation for detailed information on how these 
functions work.</p>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="Images/fit-qtl-1.png" border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Fit Cross, Phenotype and QTL Basket Selection:</H3>
<P>The first three drop-down selection boxes allow the user 
to select the cross and phenotype that the fit will be performed against along 
with the <A href="HTML/Edit_QTL_Basket.htm">QTL Basket</A> that will be the 
source of all available marker model inputs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Fit Formula Editing:</H3>
<P>The next section of the dialog contains tables and 
buttons that can be used to edit the fit formula. The model inputs table 
contains all of the available inputs to the formula, and the model terms which 
is initially empty contains a list representation of the terms selected. The 
Formula Editing buttons work as follows:</P>
<P>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=3 width="100%" align=center border=0>
  
  <TR>
    <TD><STRONG>Button Name</STRONG></TD>
    <TD><STRONG>Button is Enabled When ...</STRONG></TD>
    <TD><STRONG>Button Action</STRONG></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Add Term(s)</TD>
    <TD>Any Model Inputs are selected</TD>
    <TD>Adds the selected inputs as individual additive terms</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Add as Interactive Term</TD>
    <TD>More than one Model Input is selected</TD>
    <TD>Adds the selected inputs as an interactive term. Since J/qtl uses the 
      '*' operator instead of the ':' operator for interaction, the terms are 
      also treaded as additive.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Append Interaction(s) to Term</TD>
    <TD>At least one Model Input is selected and one Model Term is selected</TD>
    <TD>Appends the selected Model Input as an interaction with the selected 
      model term.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Remove Term</TD>
    <TD>A Model Term is selected</TD>
    <TD>Removes the selected term from the model's 
formula</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Drop-One-Term, Estimate QTL Effects and Fit Analysis Name:</H3>
<P>The remaining settings work as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Drop-One-Term Analysis: performs additional analysis 
  on the Fit Model which can be helpful in determining which model terms are the 
  most/least significant. If you choose to perform Drop-One-Term Analysis, the 
  results will be available in the <A href="Fit_Results.htm">Fit Results</A> 
  dialog.
  <LI>Estimate QTL Effects: performs additional analysis output which is 
  currently not used by J/qtl, but which can be acessed directly from R/qtl. See 
  the&nbsp;<A href="HTML/fitqtl.html">fitqtl</A> documentation for details.
  <LI>Name Your Fit Analysis: Determines which name the Fit QTL results will be 
  given in the J/qtl data tree</LI>accessed</UL>
