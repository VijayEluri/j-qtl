<h1>Histogram and Scatterplot</h1>
<p>The histogram and scatterplot graphs can be used for 
simple visualization and quality checking of the phenotype data. See <A 
href="Graph_Settings.htm">Graph Settings</A> for information about how these 
graphs can be modified.</p>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="Images/histogram-and-scatterplot.png" border=0></P>
<P>Relationships between different phenotypes can also be explored using data 
selection. For the histogram a bar can be selected using a simple mouse click 
and for the scatterplot data points can be selected using either a click or a 
"rubberband" drag select. Holding down the shift key during a selection will 
cause the newly selected points/bars to be added to the current selection rather 
than replacing the current selection. Relationships between phenotypes can be 
seen because any individuals selected in one graph will also appear as 
selections in all of the other graphs for the same cross.</P>
